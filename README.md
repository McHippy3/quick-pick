# Quick Pick
A cool, hip new app made using Google's Flutter API. 

## How It Works
The app suggests clothing based on the weather and what is available. The user inputs his/her wardrobe and clothing will then be selected using a complex, highly advanced algorithm, aka random number generation.

## How to Use
Install directly via .apk file or Google Play Store (no longer available).
